            summary: "Some people call me cocky and brash, but actually I am just self-assured. I'm nonchalant, imperturbable, contemplative.\nI play it cool, but I can get hot under the collar. And above all I'm a very 'aware' character. I'm well aware that I am appearing in an animated cartoon....\nAnd sometimes I chomp on my carrot for the same reason that a stand-up comic chomps on his cigar.\nIt saves me from rushing from the last joke to the next one too fast. And I sometimes don't act, I react. And I always treat the contest with my pursuers as 'fun and games.'\nWhen momentarily I appear to be cornered or in dire danger and I scream, don't be consoined â€“ it's actually a big put-on. Let's face it, Doc. I've read the script and I already know how it turns out."
